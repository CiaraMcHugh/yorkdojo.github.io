> Session 7 took place at 26 Feb 2017 10am - 12 noon at Clifton Green Primary, York

We had a great session, with two different groups - one doing Microbits, and another doing Scratch.

In this session, there were three groups:

- Scratch group: some doing beginners scratch and making [Flappy Bird](/assets/worksheets/session-6/flappy-parrot.pdf) and more advanced for Scratchers there was [Synchronised Swimming](/assets/worksheets/session-6/synchronised-swimming.pdf).
- [Microbit group made a Theremin](/worksheets/microbit/theremin/) and dancing [fireflies using the microbit's radio](/worksheets/microbit/fireflies/)

A big thank-you to all that came!

## Fireflies demo

So Emily S got the [microbit fireflies](/worksheets/microbit/fireflies/) working in record time, here's a little demo of it working...
