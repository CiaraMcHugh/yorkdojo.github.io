> Session 6 took place at 22 Jan 2017 9:30am - 12 noon at Clifton Green Primary, York

We'll be keeping you up-to-date with all we do on this website from now, proudly featuring all we've made and giving you the links to all the resources and worksheets we've used that month.

In this session, there were three groups:

- Scratch group: some doing beginners scratch and making [Flappy Bird](/assets/worksheets/session-6/flappy-parrot.pdf) and more advanced for Scratchers there was [Synchronised Swimming](/assets/worksheets/session-6/synchronised-swimming.pdf).
- HTML websites group: The beginners started with [Wanted Poster](/assets/worksheets/session-6/wanted.pdf).
- BBC Microbit group: [Magic 8-Ball using Python](/assets/worksheets/session-6/microbit-magic-8-ball.pdf) and [Rock-Paper-Scissors using Block editor](/assets/worksheets/session-6/rock-paper-scissors.pdf).

A big thank-you to all that came. We're going to start linking finished projects next month, so you can show off your work.
