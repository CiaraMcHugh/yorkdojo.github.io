> Session 7 took place at 25th March 2017 10am - 12 noon at Clifton Green Primary, York

We had another great session, with some doing doing Microbits, Scratch, Onnet making his own website and Ewan doing some Python.

Workhseets that we used this session:

- Scratch group: some doing beginners scratch and making [Rock Band](/assets/worksheets/session-7/rock-band.pdf).
- Microbit group made some smilie faces and [a microbit step counter](/worksheets/microbit/step-counter/)

Ewan was making a login page in Python, practicing what he's been learning in school. Onett was making his own website, and just needing a little help - we're going to try and publish it online next month!

A big thank-you to all that came!
