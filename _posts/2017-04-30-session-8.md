> Session 8 took place at 30th April 2017 10am - 12 noon at Clifton Green Primary, York

We had another great session, getting to close to our capacity now! We experimented with Microbits, Scratch, and Onnet was making his own website.

Worksheets that we used this session:

- Scratch group: some doing beginners scratch with [flappy parrot](/assets/worksheets/session-6/flappy-parrot.pdf) and making [Rock Band](/assets/worksheets/session-7/rock-band.pdf).
- Microbit group made [a microbit step counter](/worksheets/microbit/step-counter/) and started [a microbit meteor game](/worksheets/microbit/meteors/)
- And Emily started looking into [Arduino, measuring the moisture of plants using a special sensor](/worksheets/arduino/plant-moisture-tweeter/)

A big thank-you to all that came!
